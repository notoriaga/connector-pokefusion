This is the README for you API. It is intended to guide other developers on
**internal implementation** of your code, like how to set up a workflow project
or connector API. It **will not** be displayed in your
[Standard Library](https://stdlib.com/) documentation.

You can include an **Deploy to Build on Standard Library** button for GitHub,
as displayed above.
